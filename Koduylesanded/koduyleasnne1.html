		Alphonse Maria Mucha (24 July 1860 - 14 July 1939) was a Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist, most well known for his images of women. He produced many paintings, illustrations, advertisements and designs.
		</p>


		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>
		Alphonse Maria Mucha was born in the town of <b>Ivančice, Moravia</b> (currently a region of the Czech Republic). In 1871, Mucha became a chorister at the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Brno, where he received his secondary school education.
		</p>

		<p>
		Drawing had been his main hobby since childhood. Mucha moved to <b>Paris in 1887</b>, and continued his studies at <b>Académie Julian and Académie Colarossi</b>. In addition to his studies, he worked at producing magazine and advertising illustrations.
		</p>

		<p>
		Mucha produced a flurry of paintings, posters, advertisements, and book illustrations, as well as designs for jewelry, carpets, wallpaper, and theatre sets in what was termed initially The Mucha Style but became known as <b>Art Nouveau</b> (French for "new art"). Mucha's works frequently featured beautiful young women in flowing, vaguely Neoclassical-looking robes, often surrounded by lush flowers which sometimes formed halos behind their heads. In contrast with contemporary poster makers he used <b>pale pastel colors.</b><br>

		</p>

		<p>
		His Art Nouveau style was often imitated. The Art Nouveau style, however, was one that Mucha attempted to <b>disassociate himself from throughout his life</b>; he always insisted that rather than maintaining any fashionable stylistic form, his paintings were entirely a product of himself and Czech art. He declared that <u>art existed only to communicate a spiritual message, and nothing more</u>; hence his frustration at the fame he gained by his commercial art, when he most wanted to <b>concentrate on more artistic projects.</b>
